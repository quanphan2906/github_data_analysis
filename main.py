To that end, I examine the correlations between open source project licenses and key project metrics, including

f"""The majority of the repositories ({analysis.license_counts_percentage["MIT License"].round()}%) are licensed under the MIT license, which is well expected. The MIT license is known for its permissiveness, simplicity and compatibility with many other types of licenses, which makes it a popular choice among developers and organizations, all-size alike. While Apache 2.0 ({analysis.license_counts_percentage["Apache 2.0"].round()}%) and GNU GPL 3.0 ({analysis.license_counts_percentage["GNU GPL v3.0"].round()}%) are all popular options, their popularity is nowhere near the MIT license."""
