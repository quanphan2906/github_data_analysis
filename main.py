"In software engineering, especially in the open-source world, a license of a project provides important information on how people other than the authors can use, distribute, and modify the project."

"In this analysis, I want to understand how the choice of license changes across different open-sourced projects and communities. More specifically, I want to answer three questions..."

    1. What is the most popular license in the open-sourced world?

    3. How does the choice of license differs across open-source communities (by programming language)?

    "To understand the _why_ behind the distribution of these three most popular licenses, let's learn about their most distinctive features:"
)

st.markdown(
    """
__MIT license__ is known for its simplicity and permissive nature. It allows users to do almost anything they want with the code, even distributing, sublicensing, and selling copies of the software. The only major requirement is to include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software/source code. Thus, it is not difficult to see why the MIT license, With its simplicity and minimal requirements, is the most appealing license for open-source developers.
"""
)

st.markdown(
    """
    __Apache License 2.0__ is as permissive as MIT license, and users can do almost anything they want with the code. However, a distinctive feature of the Apache License is its explicit grant of patent rights from contributors to users, protecting users from patent litigation. In addition, it requires modifications to be documented, making it easier for subsequent users to understand what was altered.
    """
)

st.markdown(
    """
    In contrast to MIT and Apache 2.0, __GNU GPL v3.0__ is known for its strong copyleft requirement. If you distribute modified versions of GPLv3-licensed software, you must also distribute the entire source code under GPLv3. This ensures that all modified versions of the software remain free and open.
    """
)

"In short, while being as permissive as the MIT license, both Apache 2.0 and GNU GPL v3.0 cannot top the champion due to their additional requirements, which significantly contribute to the maintenance 'costs' of the open-source project."

st.subheader("Hypothesis")
"One hypothesis that might spring off from our understanding of the licenses is that..."

st.markdown(
    """
- MIT license might be more appealing to a typical, small-scale project due to its simplicity. 
- Conversely, the Apache 2.0 License is more appealing for larger, more popular, and commercially-oriented projects because it offers more protection against patent infringement claims and has explicit grants of patent rights.
"""

st.subheader("Popular vs. regular repositories")

st.markdown(
    """To examine this hypothesis, I need to distinguish large and popular repositories versus typical, small-scale ones. To do this, I use a proxy metric, that is the weighted average of a several numeric metrics in the dataset.
    """
)

st.markdown(
    """
    Here's my formal definition: A popular (and mature) project is any project with the __weighted average number of stars, watchers, forks, and pull requests larger than the upper interquartile range of this metric__. The rest, I call regular projects.

st.markdown(
    """
    In defining my proxy metric, I intentionally leave out the number of commits. My _assumption_ is that the number of commits does not necessarily correlate with the maturity of a project. A high number of commits might just mean a high number of bug fixes. Alternatively, beginner developers can push many commits without good reasons. I also use the upperquartile range of this proxy metric as a cutoff point because as a norm in the Stats community, anything beyond the upperquartile range is considered outliers, i.e "the top of the top". In my analysis, I really want to focus on the constrast between this "extreme" group and the rest.
    """
)

st.subheader("Result")

"While MIT license dominates in both the popular and regular-size project groups, the percentage is considerably higher in the latter (10 percentage unit difference). Among the three, only Apache 2.0 has a higher usage rate in the popular project group compared to the typical group."

license_distribution_outliers, license_distribution_typical = data.get_license_distribution()
data.plot_license_dist(license_distribution_outliers, license_distribution_typical)

"This result confirms the direction of my initial hypothesis, that a small-scale project is more likely to use the MIT license and the popular, mature projects are more likely to use Apache 2.0. However, the magnitude of difference is not as significant as I expected."

st.header("‚å®Ô∏è Prefered license types across different open-sourced communities")

"In this section, I have no hypothesis to start out with, so let's begin by getting to know the largest programming communities:"

top_10_languages = data.get_and_plot_top_10_languages()

"This is a well-expected list, with Python and Javascript taking the lead. Let's see how the choice of license differs across these programming-language communities."

data.plot_lang_and_license(top_10_languages)

"The high usage proportion of MIT license in Javascript (JS) and Typescript (TS) projects (approximately 70% for both groups) well aligns with the strong culture of sharing and building upon others' work in the web development world (which heavily uses JS and TS)."

"Another factor that might influence the wide adoption of the MIT license in the JS and TS communities is the fact that many large and influential projects in these languages (like Angular, React, Express.js) use the MIT License, setting a precedent for others in the community."

"In contrast..."

data.plot_lang_and_license(top_10_languages, "Apache License 2.0")

"Apache License 2.0 is significantly more popular in the Java community than the rest. The connection between these two are more subtle. One hypothesis is that since both Java and Apache 2.0 (with its explicit grants of patent rights) are widely used in the enterprise environments, there are more Java projects with Apache 2.0 than other languages."

"Finally..."

data.plot_lang_and_license(top_10_languages, "GNU General Public License v3.0")

"GNU GPL v3.0 is more widely used in the C++ and Python communities than the rest, although the difference is not that significant."
